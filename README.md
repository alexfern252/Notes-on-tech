my notes on tech
Software as a Service (SaaS; pronounced /s√¶s/) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription
basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software". 
SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. 
Such communications can include voice over IP
(VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices.
